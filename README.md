# TicTacToe-puzzle
Designed and implemented software for heuristically efficient algorithm to solve tic-tac-toe puzzle using C++.
The game was successfully implemented using 5 different techniques namely, Min-Max Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Killer Heuristics, rotation invariance (90,180,270) & Heuristic approach. 
The performance of these algorithms were also analyzed to determine the optimal solution
